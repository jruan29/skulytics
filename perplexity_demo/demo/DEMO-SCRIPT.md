## 🎬 OPENING (30 seconds)

**[Show Main Dashboard]**

> "This is Skulytics - an AI-powered eCommerce performance intelligence platform. What makes it different? It doesn't just show you problems - it helps you solve them. Let me show you a real workflow."

---

## 🔴 ACT 1: PROBLEM DETECTION (1 minute)

**[Point to Alert Panel]**

> "Every morning, the platform proactively surfaces the issues that matter most. Here we have 5 active alerts ranked by business impact."

**[Hover over Alert 1]**

> "This one's urgent - SKU003, our Multi-Purpose Cleaner, has seen conversion drop 22% at Target. The AI has already identified three contributing factors: stockouts, rating decline, and a competitor price cut."

**[Click "Investigate"]**

> "One click, and watch this..."

**[Wait for dashboard to filter - emphasize the dynamic update]**

> "The entire dashboard instantly filters to this product. Every metric, every chart updates in real-time. No manual searching, no switching between tools."

---

## 🔵 ACT 2: ROOT CAUSE DIAGNOSIS (1.5 minutes)

**[Click "View Full Product Analysis"]**

> "Now let's understand exactly what's causing this problem."

**[Point to KPI tiles]**

> "Look at these diagnostic tiles - our organic rank is actually stable at #3, so visibility isn't the issue. But here's the smoking gun..."

**[Point to CVR tile and Stock Status tile]**

> "Conversion dropped 22%, and we were out of stock for 3 days. That's your primary driver."

**[Scroll to charts]**

> "This time-series chart tells the whole story. CVR was steady around 3.6%, then crashed during the out-of-stock period. It's recovering but hasn't bounced back."

**[Point to Opportunity Table]**

> "But here's where it gets powerful. The platform doesn't just show you the problem - it ranks every opportunity by forecasted business impact."

**[Hover over Row 4]**

> "Look at this - we also have a content issue. Low image score, weak description. If we fix this, we could recover another $1,200 in sales and jump from rank #3 to #1. Let me simulate that."

---

## 🟢 ACT 3: SCENARIO SIMULATION (1 minute)

**[Click "Simulate Fix"]**

> "This is the scenario simulator. It shows me exactly what happens if I make these changes."

**[Point to Current vs. Simulated columns]**

> "Currently, our image score is 42 out of 100 - we only have 3 product shots. If we add 2 lifestyle images and optimize the description, we jump to 85."

**[Point to Forecasted Impact]**

> "And here's the business impact: rank improves to #1, conversion recovers by 0.8 points, sales lift of $1,200 over two weeks. 85% confidence based on historical data."

**[Click "Apply Changes"]**

> "One click to queue the fix."

---

## 🟡 ACT 4: AI-POWERED CONTENT FIX (1.5 minutes)

**[Content Crafter loads]**

> "And now we're in the Content Crafter. This is where the AI becomes your creative partner."

**[Point to 3-column layout]**

> "Left column - our existing content. Look at how bare this is: generic title, 7-word description, only 3 images."

**[Point to middle column]**

> "Middle column - what the AI recommends. It's analyzed our top competitors, Target's content guidelines, and SEO best practices."

**[Read new title]**

> "'CleanHome Eco-Friendly Multi-Purpose Cleaner | Antibacterial, Non-Toxic Formula' - brand name, keywords, value props. Compare that to just 'Multi-Purpose Cleaner.'"

**[Scroll to description]**

> "The description now mentions use cases, ingredients, safety features - everything a shopper wants to know."

**[Point to right column]**

> "And the impact forecast is right here: content score 58 to 88, rank #3 to #1, $2,400 sales lift."

**[Click "Deploy Changes"]**

> "One click to deploy these changes across Target's catalog."

**[Wait for success message and balloons]**

> "Deployed. Impact tracking is now live."

---

## 💜 ACT 5: CLOSED-LOOP VALIDATION (45 seconds)

**[Click "Track Impact"]**

> "Now here's what separates this from every other analytics tool - closed-loop measurement."

**[Point to Before/After table]**

> "Two weeks later, here's what actually happened. We didn't just meet the forecast - we exceeded it. Actual sales lift was $2,650 versus the predicted $2,400."

**[Point to AI Summary]**

> "And the AI learns from this. It's already recommending we apply this same strategy to SKU002 and SKU004."

---

## 🎁 BONUS: AI COPILOT (30 seconds - only if time allows)

**[Navigate back to Main Dashboard]**

> "One more thing - if you ever need guidance, we have an AI Copilot."

**[Click "Ask in Chat" on any alert]**

> "It understands the full context of every issue and can walk you through diagnosis, simulation, and action - all in natural language."

**[Show one AI response]**

> "This is like having an expert analyst available 24/7."

---

## 🎯 CLOSING (30 seconds)

**[Go back to Main Dashboard full view]**

> "So that's Skulytics. From problem detection to root cause analysis, scenario simulation, AI-powered fixes, and impact validation - all in one seamless workflow. 

> This demo is running on real Streamlit code with actual data architecture underneath. Everything you saw - the filtering, the charts, the AI responses - is fully functional.

> And here's the key: this isn't beauty industry-specific. We've built this with generic CPG products to show it works across any category - household goods, beverages, snacks, personal care, pet food - any eCommerce brand with products on retail shelves."

**[Pause]**

> "Questions?"

## 🎤 ANTICIPATING QUESTIONS

### "How does the AI work?"
> "The platform combines rule-based analysis with machine learning. For content optimization, it benchmarks against top performers and applies proven SEO principles. For forecasting, it learns from historical outcomes - that's why confidence scores improve over time."

### "Can it integrate with our data?"
> "Yes - the platform has a universal data integration layer. It can ingest data from any retailer API, feed file, or internal system. The GenAI handles schema mapping automatically."

### "What about different retailers?"
> "The beauty is that it adapts. Content recommendations are retailer-specific - what works on Amazon differs from Target. The AI learns each retailer's guidelines and shopper preferences."

### "How long to implement?"
> "The core platform can be set up in weeks. We'd start with one retailer and category to prove value, then expand. Most clients see ROI within the first quarter."

### "Does it only do content?"
> "No - what you saw was three of seven modules. We also have Demand Forecasting for inventory optimization, Media Spend for paid campaign efficiency, Competitor Intel for market insights, and Mapping for product identification across channels."

### "What if I want to make changes myself?"
> "Every AI recommendation can be edited manually. The platform is a co-pilot, not an auto-pilot. You have full control."
